    summary:
      "Pala'wan Indigenous residents of Sitio Linao maintained a barricade for nearly three months to block heavy equipment from entering their ancestral domain, before it was dismantled on June 29 to let CALMIA Nickel, Inc.'s Infanta Nickel Project proceed. Rights groups say the project moved forward without the community's free, prior, and informed consent.",

    summary:
      'Even with the 2025 moratorium in place, 11 existing mining companies remain grandfathered into operation, continuing to threaten Indigenous ancestral domains and biodiversity hotspots like Mt. Mantalingahan. The authors trace how mining for the global green-energy transition has been linked to roughly a third of all killings of environmental and human-rights defenders in the Philippines.',

    summary:
      "Palawan holds nearly half the Philippines' old-growth forest, 30% of its mangroves, and 40% of its coral reefs — ecosystem services environmental groups and local bishops value at roughly $5 billion, which they argue outweighs mining profits. Global nickel demand for EV batteries is projected to rise 65% by 2030, keeping pressure on the province even after its new moratorium.",
